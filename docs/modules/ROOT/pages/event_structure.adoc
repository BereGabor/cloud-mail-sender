= Event structure

Event could have a standard structure, where the 'data' element contains a base64 encoded request body, but it can process when the pure JSON is the event (as the test function creates an event in the GCP console).

[source,json]
----
{
        "from": "sender@senderdomain.com",
        "to":"sample@gmail.com",
        "subject":"Test mail subject",
        "body":"Hello GÃ¡bor!\n \n Have a nice day! \n\n Best regards\nBere"
}
----

`from` is optional. If 'from' is not set in the request, the system will use a default value.
